# notebooks
A repo for collecting various Jupyter notebooks explaining and exploring topics related to my graduate research and more!

The main reason for this repo existing is to get more of my work centralized in a public space. I intend to focus the topics of most notebooks to an area relevant to my research efforts as a grad student in cognitive science -- particularly subjects about/adjacent to cognitive modelling & AI, data science, and simulation. A caveat: since my interests are quite broad, I don't consider this statement a mandate; in the effort of making my work (and interests) more publically available, the content of my notebooks may diverge over time. In particular, if something I am learning about can be explained interactively in a notebook, I will likely put it here.

Note that each notebook will be pushed out in various states of completion, containing a header describing its latest status.
